# The Prelude

When we sent out invitations, we asked a big question to our guests: **Who owns and controls the Black historical and cultural record?** That question begets other troubling questions as soon as we pose it.

- How do we answer the question of ownership and control in the context of today's hybrid record, both analog and digital?
- Who controls access to data about slavery?
- What role does material about slavery play in the movement for reparations for colonial harms and the evils of the trans-Atlantic slave trade?
- Should descendants of ensalved people be stakeholders at the decision-making table in matters of the historical and cultural record of Black people?
- What happens when data about Black people and historical figures is created or curated by people who are not Black?
- What role do universities and large funders play in supporting, stewarding, maintaining, or circumventing who owns Black data?
- What further implications should we consider when data about Black people, particularly enslaved people, is commodified, monetized or used as leverage within current regimes of private property?
- How do we begin to connect these questions to the role that ownership and property have played in Black History?

We asked our guests to give us preliminary answers to any of the questions that grabbed them to help our conversation start before we arrive in Baltimore at the end of March. Some of our guests answered our call. Now we invite you, our audience, to read their answers and provide us yours in the comment section at the end of the page [add an internal link].
