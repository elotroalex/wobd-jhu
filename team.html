      <a href="https://soc.jhu.edu/directory/alexandre-white/"target="_blank"> <strong>Alexandre White</strong></a> is an Assistant Professor of Sociology and of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University and School of Medicine. He is the PI of <em><a href="https://underwritingsouls.org"target="_blank">Underwriting Souls</a></em>, a project to digitize the archives of Lloyd’s, the insurance market pertaining to  trans-Atlantic slavery. This work produced a digital archive and online exhibitions based on these materials as well as a partnership which produced a visual art and poetry volume.  
In addition to his role as faculty, he is also the Associate Director for the <em><a href="https://hopkinsmedicalhumanities.org target="_blank">Center for Medical Humanities and Social Medicine</a></em>. His research foci, at the intersections of the sociology of race and ethnicity, history of medicine, and global historical sociology, critically investigates global racial formations and how racial forms of governance, rooted primarily in imperial projects, have produced contemporary social phenomena. 
White’s first book <em><a href="https://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=34274" target="_blank">Epidemic Orientalism</a></em> was published by Stanford University Press. This book explores how epidemic threats become the focus of international management, regulation and control, as well as the political, economic and racial ideologies that have shaped international coordination to stop
pandemic spread.
